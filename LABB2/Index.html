<h1> Reading </h1>
<h2> About my hobby </h2>
<p>  <mark>My favourite hobby is reading </mark>. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I
started to <em>do it when I was four years old</em>. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy
when I read a story with a happy ending. <strong>I was thrilled when I read a detective story</strong> </p>
<h2> More about my hobby </h2>
<p> I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my
favourite author, J.K.Rowling who writes “ Harry Potter” . There are a lot of
advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new
vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me
an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future </p>
