    <h1> Reading </h1>
    <h2> About my hobby </h2>
    <p>
        <mark>My favourite hobby is reading </mark>. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I
        started to <em>do it when I was four years old</em>. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
        kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy
        when I read a story with a happy ending. <strong>I was thrilled when I read a detective story</strong>
    </p>
    <h2> More about my hobby </h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my
        favourite author, J.K.Rowling who writes “ Harry Potter” . There are a lot of
        advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new
        vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me
        an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future
